# Csharp-Security-of-Multimedia  

This project covers the use of C# to implement various **multimedia security** and **data hiding** techniques, including:  
- **Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding**,  
- **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** image encryption and steganography,  
- Demonstrations using **Excel** to visualize **FDCT / IDCT (Forward & Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform)** principles and their effects on image compression.  

These techniques are fundamental in digital watermarking, steganography, and secure multimedia transmission.

### Least Significant Bit (LSB) Embedding  
The LSB method hides secret information within the least significant bits of image pixels.  
It is a simple yet effective approach for steganography â€” embedding data invisibly inside multimedia content.
